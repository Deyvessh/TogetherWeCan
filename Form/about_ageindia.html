                <h5 class="card-subtitle text-muted">About</h5>
                <p class="card-text">HelpAge India is a secular, apolitical, non-profit and a non-governmental organisation in India registered
                    under the Societies' Registration Act of 1860. Set up in 1978, HelpAge India is a registered national
                    level voluntary organisation. Since its foundation, its mission is to work for the cause and care of
                    disadvantaged older persons, in order to improve the quality of their lives.</p>
                <h5 class="card-subtitle text-muted">History</h5>
                <p class="card-text">HelpAge India began in the late 1960s when the speaker of the Lok Sabha visited his counterpart in the House
                    of Commons of the United Kingdom, who was also honorary secretary of Help the Aged. He came back with
                    a vision of setting up something similar in India.</p>
                <p>But it took seven years for this vision to take shape. In March 1974, when Jackson Cole, founder of HelpAge
                    International visited India, Samson Daniel, a philanthropist, approached him for financial help to set
                    up a member organisation in Delhi. Cole instead offered to train him to raise funds. After a three-month
                    training course in London, Daniel and his wife returned to India and organised a sponsored walk with
                    schoolchildren in Delhi. It was so successful that in 1975 HelpAge International recruited more staff
                    to cover Bombay, Madras and Calcutta.</p>
                <p>HelpAge India is one of the founding members of HelpAge International, a high-profile body having 97 member
                    countries representing the cause of the elderly at the United Nations. It is closely associated with
                    Help the Aged, UK and has received a special testimonial from the United Nations for "Dedicated service
                    in support of the United Nations Programme on Ageing". HelpAge India is also a full member of the International
                    Federation on Ageing.</p>
                <p>In April 1978, HelpAge India was registered in Delhi. Within three months it became autonomous as financial
                    support ceased from UK. Soon after, in July, the society was awarded Certificates of Exemption under
                    Sections 12A and 80G of the Income Tax Act, 1961, thus indicating general confidence in the societyâ€™s
                    affairs.
